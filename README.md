# Predicting price deviations in the Chilean energy industry

After the cost of the energy is forecasted in the Chilean industry, later, this is compared with the actual cost to monitor how close from each other they are. To monitor this, the percentage of deviation of the forecasted cost with respect to the actual cost is computed. Specifically, it is important to detect those deviation greater than 15%. Then, the goal of this problem is to predict whether the energy costs will deviate more than 15% or not, which is a classification problem 

In this project, a prediction model is built, but previusly an analysis is performed and visualizations are created to have a deeper understanding of the data.
